# LockerPuzzle
A Puzzle to determine which lockers are open in a row when open or closed in a certain sequence.

Imagine you are at a school that has student lockers. There are 1000 lockers all
shut and unlocked and 1000 students. Suppose the first student goes along the
row and opens every locker. Then the second student goes along and shuts every
other locker. After that the third student changes the state of every third
locker (if the locker is open the student shuts it, and if the locker is closed
the student opens it.) Next the fourth student changes the state of every fourth
locker.  Imagine that this continues until the thousand students have followed
the pattern with the thousand lockers. At the end, which lockers will open and
which will be closed?
