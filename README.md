# LockerPuzzle
A Puzzle to determine which lockers are open in a row when open or closed in a certain sequence.

Imagine you are at a school that has student lockers. There are 1000 lockers
all shut and unlocked and 1000 students. Suppose the first goes along the row
and opens every locker. Then the second student goes along and shuts every other
locker beginning with the second locker. After that the third student changes
the state of every third locker beginning with the third licker (if the locker
is open the student shuts it, and if the locker is closed the student open it.)
Next the fourth student changes the state of every fourth locker starting with
the fourth locker. Imagine that this continues until the thousand students have
followed the pattern with the thousand lockers. At the end, which lockers will
open and which will be closed?
